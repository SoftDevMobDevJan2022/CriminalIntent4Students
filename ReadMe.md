App: Criminal Intent
======================

# Overview
***Reference***: BNR book, Chapter 8

***CriminalIntent*** records the details of "office crimes" â€“ things like leaving dirty dishes in the break room sink or walking away
from an empty shared printer after documents have printed.

With CriminalIntent, you can make a record of a crime including a title, a date, and a photo. You
can also identify a suspect from your contacts and lodge a complaint via email, Twitter, Facebook,
or another app. After documenting and reporting a crime, you can proceed with your work free of
resentment and ready to focus on the business at hand.

CriminalIntent is a complex app that will take 11 chapters to complete. It will have a list-detail
interface: The main screen will display a list of recorded crimes, and users will be able to add new
crimes or select an existing crime to view and edit its details (Figure 8.1)
